# Lucompressor - Image Compressor

This application performs the compression and resizing of selected images;

The objective of this development is to share a demonstration of interoperability between different programming languages: This application uses C#/.NET 6.0 as main language, but for image management it uses C++/WinRT.
There is a Windows Runtime component implemented in C++/WinRT that can have its .winmd module consumed by the main project via C#/WinRT projection.

It's a simple app, which can be useful in some cases, but I hope it serves different purposes for those who access it. :)

I will be posting the app on the Microsoft Store, I will edit this file adding the link when in the store.
